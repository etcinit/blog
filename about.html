      Hi there! I’m Eduardo Trujillo. I’m a software engineer and coffee
      drinker currently living in Seattle, WA. Before moving, I studied
      Computer Science at the University of Georgia (Athens, GA).
    </p>

    <p>
      Technology in general is one of my passions, though I do tend to focus
      more on the software side of things. You’ll find me messing with either
      the frontend or backend of a system. My interests range from systems
      administration, server-side programming, to application and graphic
      design.
    </p>

    <p>
      For better or worse, Javascript and PHP are the lingua francas of the
      internet; A good chunk of my professional work has revolved around these.
      I’ve also tinkered with many other languages (Go, Python, C++) during my
      free time or for school work. However, functional languages like Haskell
      have started to win my heart over with their better safety guarantees and
      awesome features.

    <p>
      Chromabits is both the name of my blog and the pseudo-organization name
      that I use on my personal projects. Here I post, complain, share, and
      discuss about things that are going through my mind at the moment,
      projects that I’ve been working on, and topics that I find interesting.
