My name is Eduardo Trujillo (Thru-he-yoh). I'm a Computer Scientist living in
Athens, GA. (University of Georgia).

Technology in general is one of my passions. My more specific interests range
from server-side programming, to rich application design and graphic design.

My work: Quality over quantity. I'm fluent in PHP and Javascript, and also use
other languages like C++, Python, etc. I like building things from scratch and
understand how they work. I tend to prefer comprehensive solutions, not quick
hacks. I'm a gamer too. FPSs, Indies and Hack-and-slash RPGs are within my
favorites.

This is my personal blog. Here I post, complain, share, and discuss about
things that are going through my mind at the moment.
