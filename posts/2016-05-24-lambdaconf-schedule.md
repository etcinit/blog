This week I'm flying to Colorado along with some co-workers for this year's
[LambdaConf][1], which is one of the largest conferences focused on Functional
Programming out there.

Unlike some conferences I've been to in the past, LambdaConf has multiple
tracks covering multiple levels of experience. Each track has its own set of
talks, which means that you won't be able to attend all talks, but, and perhaps
more importantly, you can sort of mix and match to create your own conference
schedule!

So that's exactly what I did. Below you can see which talks I'm hoping to
attend during the conference. It's a fairly balanced mix of all three tracks
(beginner, intermediate, advanced) and a couple of alternatives.

I'm specially interested on the [Urbit][2] talk. I've read about the project in
the past and it almost sounded like something out of (Computer) Science
Fiction.

Hands-on and Haskell-related talks also sound like a lot of fun. I'm definitely
looking forward to writing my own Lisp interpreter, and learning more about the
inner workings of Haskell and advance features in its type system.

> **NOTE:** (1) Some talk names are shortened. (2) OR is used to signify parts
of the schedule I'm unsure of.
