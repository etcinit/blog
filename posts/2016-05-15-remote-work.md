- Introduction
    - Moving is hard. It's not an easy decision.
    - I was recently precented with the opportunity of working remotely for my
    current job.
    - As a result, I've been reading on working remote, and how to make the
    most of it.
- Why work remotely?
    - Happiness
        - I think personal happiness is probably or should be one of the main
        driving factors behind moving somewhere.
        - For me, going to Seattle is a big plus in this area, given that the
        number of possible weekend activities grows significantly, that there
        is a larger number of programming meetups in the area, and generally
        the niceness of being in an urban region.
    - Opportunity
        - Moving somewhere should also be about the opportinities. This closely
        relate to the previous.
    - Work

- Why not?
    - Cost
        - The cost of living should be one of the main things to consider while
        moving.
        - Rent definitely being one of the largest expenses.
        - If where you want to move is more expensive, it shouldn't discourage
        you from considering it, but you should definitely weight the positives
        more carefully.
    - Social
        - There is a social cost as well. Moving means saying goodbye to a lot
        of friends, and only being able to communicate online.
        - Depending on where you are moving to, making new friendships might
        be easy or hard.
        - In my case, I've been hearing about a thing called the "Seattle
        Freeze", which probably means it won't be the easiest.
    - Work:
        - As I mentioned earlier, there are some jobs that lend themselves
        pretty well to remote work. However, there are also some positions that
        benefit from you being there.
        - Equally, just as how there are some who can self-manage, theres also
        people who are more comfortable with not having to worry about that.
- How?
    - Communication
        - Being away means that you have really good communication with the
        rest of your team.
        - I've noticed that other team members who have experienced working
        before, or currently, tend to be more involved in remote calls.
        - If you are the only remote worker on a team, it definitely can be
        harder, since simple things like setting up a remote call seems more
        like a hassel rather than routine.
        - The tools you use are also important. Slack, Phabricator, etc have
        made it really easy to collaborate online with teams.
        - Overusing these tools can also have a negative effect however.
        The makers of 1Password, AgileBits recently made a post on why they
        stopped using Slack. [link]. It can definitely go bad, but I think they
        are beneficial in moderation.
    - Place of work
        - Finding or defining a place of work seems really important. I've seen
        it mentioned on almost every article/post I've read on remote work,
        and it definitely makes sense.
        - When working on an office, this place is, well, the office. You get
        to your desk, you work, and then you leave. When working remote, this
        disctinction is not as clear, so you have to take some extra steps to
        make it happen.
        - For some people, having a home office or desk dedicated to work is
        enough. Others are more confortable with going to a co-working space,
        which is as close you can probably get to working inside an office when
        remote, and theres also people who just go to coffee shops and
        libraries.
        - It seems the main goal is to have a motivation for leaving your bed
        every morning, and also having clear definitions of work time and time
        off.
    - Staying organized
        - Besides having somewhere to work, having some idea of what to work on
        every day is important.
        - If your team uses a project development framework or philosophy,
        this might not require much work since a project manager or Scrum
        master might be managing this for you.
        - However, keeping a list of daily goals doesn't hurt either. This is
        another recurring mention I've seen on a couple of articles.
        - Keeping a list of 2 to 3 daily goals to achieve every day, should
        help with focus. However, these should be planned beforehand.
- Conclusion
